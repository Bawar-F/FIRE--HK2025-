# Photo Documentation Guidelines

Visual documentation is encouraged. It helps everyone understand what you're building.

## Folder organization
```
photos/
├── pignite/YYYY-MM-DD/      # Date folders
├── rotom/YYYY-MM-DD/
└── charmander/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

## What to photograph
- Work in progress
- Completed assemblies
- Test setups
- Problems you encounter
- Before/after comparisons
- Safety equipment in use

## File naming
- Use descriptive names: ignition-coil-assembly.jpg
- Include dates: 2024-09-01-chamber-test.mp4
- Avoid spaces: use dashes or underscores

## Tips
- Take photos throughout your work, not just at the end
