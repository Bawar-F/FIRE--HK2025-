# Charmander – Material Gathering (Manual sampling, Waste Management – moving)

Purpose: build manual sampling and the moving part that transfers material and post-burn waste.

## What lives here
- cad/: drawings and jigs
- hw/: mechanisms and parts lists
- sw/: scripts or small tools for this module (shared code in shared/)

## Acceptance (first milestone)
- Manual sampling works with consistent dimensions
- The moving part can transfer waste safely to the chamber’s collection point
- Basic status/IDs are produced to link a sample to a test
