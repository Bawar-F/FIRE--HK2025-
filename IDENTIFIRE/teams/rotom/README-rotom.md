# Rotom – Chamber, Ventilation, Waste, UI

Purpose: build the chamber and airflow, manage waste in the chamber, and provide a simple user interface.

## What lives here
- cad/: drawings and models
- hw/: chamber build notes and parts
- sw/: UI or scripts for this module (shared code goes in shared/)

## Acceptance (first milestone)
- Chamber can be closed safely and ventilated
- Basic UI to start/stop a test and show key readings
- Post-burn temperature drops to a safe threshold before open
