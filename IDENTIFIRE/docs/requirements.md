# Requirements (from report §1.4)

## Stakeholders
- Portable, robust (field conditions)
- Trustworthy ignition risk measurements
- Safe to handle (warm/dry conditions)

## Team constraints
- ≤ 20 kg, ≤ 90 L (backpack-like)
- ≤ 10 min per sample (end-to-end)
- Sampling fully automatic; burn test is primary; simple moisture as auxiliary
- Measures: time_to_ignition_s [s], burn_rate_mm_per_min [mm/min]
- Sample the top layer (~2–3 cm)
